				<p>Whispering spirit is a fairly new company that started in 2013. The company was starting because the founder Laura Gordon was volunteering at the therapeutic riding center in Renfrew County when they where rejected a grant. That grant would of made a great difference. So she decided to find away to raise money for them.  She put her creative skills to good use and built dream catcher out of some old horseshoes. Selling her piece of artwork to raise money.</p>
